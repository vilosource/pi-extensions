/**
 * dependency-cruiser configuration.
 *
 * Encodes architectural invariants as machine-checkable rules.
 * Each rule explains the invariant it enforces and links to the
 * design decision that motivated it.
 *
 * Add new rules ONLY when they encode an actual decision from
 * docs/strategy/ or docs/design/. Do not add rules speculatively.
 *
 * Run:  npm run depgraph
